# Poke API App

This is a simple Poke API app that fetches data from the Poke API and displays it in a 3-column grid. The app also features a search bar that allows you to update the grid dynamically according to the search term. The primary goal of this project was to practice fetching data from an API, and the design or UI were intentionally kept minimal.

## Features

- Fetches data from the Poke API to display Pokemon information.
- Displays fetched data in a 3-column grid layout.
- Utilizes a search bar to dynamically update the grid based on the search term.

## Getting Started

To run the Poke API app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/poke-api-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    cd myapp

3. Install the dependencies.

    npm install

4. Start the development Server.

    npm start

5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the app, you'll see the Pokemon data displayed in a 3-column grid format.
2. Use the search bar at the top of the page to enter a search term. The grid will dynamically update to show only the Pokemon whose names match the search term.
3. Clear the search bar to revert to the original grid displaying all Pokemon.

## Notes

- This project was created as a practice exercise to learn how to fetch data from an API and build a basic web interface. The focus was on functionality rather than design or UI aesthetics.
- The design and layout are intentionally minimalistic and may not represent a polished user interface.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the desire to improve API fetching skills and gain experience with React.
